theDemonStrator repo contains code for the DemonStrator - a demo boat used by the MARSSA community to demonstrate the use of MARSSA. 

The MARSSA platform is highly innovative and abstract, making it hard to show case. In order to overcome this challenge we have purchased an Optimist sailing dinghy and transformed it into the first MARSSA Demonstrator.

The optimist has been converted into an electric vessel, with two electric motors providing the thrust and various sensors and actuators providing real-time data and control. In the true MARSSA spirit a private cloud of computing power is present on board, making it possible to integrate systems from different vendors.

Dependencies
The Demonstrator Project has the following external dependencies:
gspd4java_0.1
gspd4java is a Java library which interfaces with the GPSd daemon. The project page is available at https://forge.hoegergroup.de/projects/gpsd4java

JSON-java
JSON-java is used by gspd4java to parse the JSON strings returnd by the GPSd daemon. The project homepage is available at https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-java

Java Modbus Library (jamod)
jamod is a Java implementation of Modbus. It provides native Java bindings for the Modbus protocol which is being used to communicate with the LabJack. The project page can be found at http://jamod.sourceforge.net/

Restlet
Restlet is being used for web services. It can run inside a servlet container or as a standalone. The current web services implementation is using a standalone web server which is also part of this same library. Ther project page is available at http://www.restlet.org/. 

FlexJSON
Flexjson is a lightweight library for serializing and deserializing Java objects into and from JSON. What's different about Flexjson is it's control over what gets serialized allowing both deep and shallow copies of objects. The project page can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexjson/files/
